# Code Analysis
The Java code in this project was generated by JetBrains AI, and I have to say, I’m pretty impressed with what it came up with. I had JetBrains AI generate this small code interaction, and for comparison, I had Google generate one as well. Google’s example was based on a car class interaction, which is a classic analogy often used in programming discussions. However, I decided to go with the library-based interaction instead, as I wanted to break away from any preconceived notions and challenge my thinking on the subject.

## Encapsulation

On the encapsulation front, the code has a few good things going for it. Each class uses private fields for instance variables, which are accompanied by control methods. While these control methods don’t do much beyond basic access, their presence is still preferable to public variables, which could lead to careless modifications.

If I were to improve this aspect, I would introduce string validation for properties like the book title and author during initialization. Similarly, I’d implement validation for a member’s name to prevent invalid data from being stored. At first glance, though, the encapsulation is *"not bad."*

One area I’d particularly like to refine is the borrow/return logic in the `Member` class. Currently, the `Member` class has two methods (`borrowBook()` and `returnBook()`) that interact directly with the `Book` class. While this approach works, I don’t love where this coupling happens. In my opinion, the borrowing and returning of books should be handled at the **Library** level rather than at the **Member** level.

From a design perspective, I don't think it should be a member’s responsibility to track which books they have checked out. Instead, the **Library** should maintain this information, determining whether books are checked in or out. This approach would strengthen the relationship between a **Book** and a **Library**, rather than between a **Book** and a **Member**, which I believe better reflects real-world library systems.

## Modularity

The modularity in this implementation is acceptable. Each class has a clearly defined area of responsibility, and the system is reusable. A **Library** can manage multiple **Members** and **Books**, and if needed, we could extend the system to include a **Town** or **City** class, allowing multiple libraries to exist within a larger system.

That said, one significant improvement I would suggest is introducing an **interface**, perhaps named `Item` or something similar. This interface could define essential methods such as `isAvailable()` and `borrow()`, which the `Book` class would then implement. Doing so would allow the library to manage more than just books (e.g., magazines, DVDs, or other loanable items) while reducing class coupling. By enforcing a contract through an interface, we ensure that any future additions adhere to the same borrowing logic while allowing individual implementations to handle the specifics.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, this implementation is solid, especially considering it was AI-generated. However, there are opportunities to refine the encapsulation and borrowing logic to improve maintainability and better reflect real-world systems. Introducing an interface would also enhance modularity and flexibility for future expansion.

Would love to hear your thoughts—especially on the **Member vs. Library** book tracking decision!
